     <p>navigation tag (nav) is always inside a header tag. we have 2 types of list unordered (ul) and
         ordered (ol). list items can be listed using li tag
     </p>

<p class="content">to add color or basically style the sheet we use css. create a new file abc.css, link the cc file in the main 
    prog using link tag inside the head tag.
</p>
this is by targetting the element name. but it will change all the content under thr element. e.g if u change the colour of all the 
content in h1. the the h1 colour will change not only for the line you want.
in order to avoid this we need to target a class, i.e. we put a perticulat line with a perticular element under a class.
to do this before > of any tag add class and give a name.
but the same class name can be given for multiple elements.
instead an id can be used to be more spchific. done using id in a similar way as of class.
<br>
<br>
<p>
    there are 3 types of borders the we can add to an element using border tag. solid dotted dashed
we can adjust the size of the amout the space around the border using margin tag.
the white space inside can be changed using padding tag.
</p>

<div class="flex">
    <p>
        flex boxes need a parent containet in order to work.the elements inside that container can be adjusted, centered and 
        moved around easily. we use display - flex so that when screen size is reduced the boxes align themselves instead of getting
        smaller in size. we use margin whiich puts a margin all around the parent container. justify content usde used to align the 
        boxes. it can be center, flex start, flex end, space between or space around. flex direction can be used by using row, row 
        reverse or column or column reverse. similarly align items can be usde alont=g with flex end, flex start, center, baseline, 
        stretch.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        animations
        <br>
        we can create animations for the boxes. in order to to that we need to clreat the animation. we use @keyframes to do so.
        and then we give a name.
        <br>
        1. <b>fading - </b>we use opacity - value ranges between 0 and 1 where 0 means invisible and 1 means completely visible. there we use 
        0% which means start of the animation and 100% means end of the animation. we assign this animation for the box by using its 
        id. we use animation name, animation detation for how long it is suppose to run, animation iteration count for the no. of times
        the animation has to run and animation timing function the defines the speed throughout the cycle. here we use linear so that
        times remains same all throughout.
        <br>
        2. rotate - we use transform - roate and then give a degree. for a graidant backgroung colour we use backgroung image and then 
        radial gradiant or linear gradiant. under this we say the shape say circle or linear may be.(comma next to this is very imp)
        the then put in some colours.
        <br>
        3. bigger - we use transform - scale and give a value. 1 is initial.
        <br>
        4. colour - we use backgroung colour. we use forward so that the animation stops at the final colour or if we put infinite 
        it keeps going on if not it comes back to default colour. 
        <br>
        5. move - to move wrt to the top left point we use top and left. 
        <br>
        position (a) relative - if we specify a position, box moves to that position within the container wrt its initial pos.
        (b) absolute - it moves the the actual position on the screen(could be out of the container).
        (c) fixed - it to it actual pos as in case of absolute but remains fixed and does not get away from screen.
    </p>
<div class="Box" id="Box1">box 1</div>
<div class="Box" id="Box2">box 2</div>
<div class="Box" id="Box3">box 3</div>
<div class="Box" id="Box4">box 4</div>
<div class="Box" id="Box5">box 5</div>
<div class="Box" id="Box6">box 6</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>
    text can be aligned using text align.
    <br>
    while styling the nav bar, we can remove the underline for links using text decoration line for link tag. bulletins can be removed 
    using list style. 
    <br>
    the changes done to the nav bar here will not be reflected on the 'about' page. so the style sheet link has to be added on the about page.
</p>
<p>
    we can make an img in circle shape by using border radius in style sheet.
    <br>
    we can create shadows for the images using box shadow. first value represents the shadoe for the right side of the img. 2nd for 
    the bottom, 3rd for the blurring, 4th for size of shadow(optional), 5ht for colour.
    <br>
    internal shadow can be created using inset.
    <br>
    shadows for texts can be created using text shadows.
     
</p>
<br>
<p>
    to put background for the whole sheet we use background image and then write the address. we can also we linear or radial gradiant
    for a gradiant background. while using linear gradiant we can specify the direction using 'to right', 'to bottom', etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    we can creat forms using form tag. we use required which ensures that the field does not go unfilled. placeholder 
    displays what has to be displayed on screen about the field. we use input for all normal text inputs. we use textbox for a text box
    and button for a button. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    to make things more better, we use materialise. go to the website to use. 
    we can use various kinf of things there. first we use the nav bar. we just need to copy and paste the code. before that to get
    access from the materialise page we need to copy 2 links that connects their inbuit code to out page. there links are in the home
    page of the website under the heading CND. the first link is for css and is supposed to be pasted in the head to the code. the 
    second link is a java script link and it would be the last line of out body tag.(so paster before the closing body tag). this 
    is done so because we dont want any java codes in b/w and also it tends to make our page slower.
    <br>
    we use text inputs text spcaes. to activate icons we need to copy a link from icons page and paste it in our head tag. we use text 
    area for messge box and button for a submit button. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    to creat css grid we go to the website of grid by example. currently we choose the layering items format. we first copy the html 
    code and then the css code. we can change the values of rows and clumns accordingly. z inder is used for layering. we define 
    one value for z index in the css definition of box class. we again use z index for the box which we need to layer. here we have 
    layered box f. the value of z index while for box f should be more than the actually defined value. it just could be anything.
    <br>
    so we put in images in each box give them a size in html and center them using css. for box c and box f we have given a background 
    colour which just helps to show what exactly the z index does.
